# üé≤ 3D File Upload Testing Guide

## Current Status ‚úÖ

- Backend is properly configured for 3D file uploads
- 3D files are being saved to `uploads/3d_models/` directory
- File type detection is working correctly
- Several 3D models have already been uploaded successfully

## Existing 3D Models in Database

From the database check, these 3D artworks are already working:

- **Artwork 40**: "3ddd" - GLTF model (damaged_helmet.gltf)
- **Artwork 41**: "Antique Camera" - GLTF model
- **Artwork 42**: "Car" - FBX model
- **Artwork 43**: "3d" - FBX model
- **Artwork 45**: "veh" - FBX model (Car.fbx)

## How to Test 3D File Upload

### Step 1: Login to Frontend

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Login with any existing user:
   - **Aarya Bhansali**: aarya.bhansali@somaiya.edu
   - **Test User**: test@example.com
   - Or register a new account

### Step 2: Navigate to Add Artwork

1. Click "Add Artwork" or go to `/add-artwork`
2. You'll see the DebugUpload component at the top

### Step 3: Test Upload with Debug Tool

1. **Use the Debug Upload Tool** (gray box at top of page):
   - Click "Test Server Connection" first
   - Select a 3D file (.gltf, .glb, .fbx, .obj, .stl, etc.)
   - Click "Test Upload"
   - Check the results in the green/red box

### Step 4: Test Full Upload Flow

1. Fill out the artwork form:
   - Title: "My 3D Model"
   - Category: "3D Models"
   - Subcategory: Choose appropriate one
   - Set a price
2. Go to Step 2 (Upload Files)
3. Drag and drop or select 3D files
4. Verify files appear with 3D preview
5. Click "Publish Artwork"

## Supported 3D File Types

- **.gltf** - GLTF JSON format ‚úÖ
- **.glb** - GLTF Binary format ‚úÖ
- **.fbx** - Autodesk FBX ‚úÖ
- **.obj** - Wavefront OBJ ‚úÖ
- **.stl** - Stereolithography ‚úÖ
- **.blend** - Blender files ‚úÖ
- **.dae** - COLLADA ‚úÖ
- **.3ds** - 3D Studio ‚úÖ
- **.ply** - Polygon File Format ‚úÖ

## File Size Limits

- Maximum file size: **100MB**
- Multiple files can be uploaded per artwork

## Troubleshooting

### If Upload Fails:

1. **Check Authentication**: Make sure you're logged in
2. **Check File Type**: Ensure file has supported extension
3. **Check File Size**: Must be under 100MB
4. **Check Backend Console**: Look for detailed error logs
5. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed requests in browser DevTools

### Common Issues:

- **401 Unauthorized**: Not logged in or token expired
- **400 Bad Request**: File type not supported or too large
- **500 Server Error**: Backend issue, check server logs

### Debug Information:

- Backend logs all upload attempts with detailed info
- Frontend DebugUpload component shows step-by-step process
- Files are saved to `artvault-backend/uploads/3d_models/`
- Database stores file metadata and URLs

## Verification Steps

After successful upload:

1. Check `artvault-backend/uploads/3d_models/` for the physical file
2. Go to Marketplace to see your artwork listed
3. Click on artwork to see 3D model displayed
4. Verify 3D model loads and is interactive (rotate, zoom)

## Backend File Structure

```
artvault-backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 3d_models/     ‚Üê 3D files saved here
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/        ‚Üê Image files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ videos/        ‚Üê Video files
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ audio/         ‚Üê Audio files
```

## Success Indicators

- ‚úÖ File appears in uploads/3d_models/ directory
- ‚úÖ Artwork appears in database with correct file metadata
- ‚úÖ 3D model displays in marketplace with interactive viewer
- ‚úÖ File type detected as "3d_model"
- ‚úÖ Proper file extension and format stored

The system is working correctly! The issue might be with authentication or frontend form submission rather than the 3D file handling itself.
