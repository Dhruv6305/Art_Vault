# ArtVault Payment System Implementation

## Overview

A complete payment system has been implemented for the ArtVault application, allowing users to purchase artworks through a simulated payment gateway. The system includes order management, shipping calculations, and a multi-step checkout process.

## Components Implemented

### 1. PaymentModal (`/src/components/payment/PaymentModal.jsx`)

- Main modal component that orchestrates the payment flow
- Manages three steps: Order Summary → Payment Details → Success Confirmation
- Handles modal state and data flow between components

### 2. OrderSummary (`/src/components/payment/OrderSummary.jsx`)

- Displays artwork details and pricing
- Collects shipping information
- Allows quantity selection (respects artwork availability)
- Calculates taxes and shipping costs
- Offers multiple shipping options (Standard, Express, Overnight)

### 3. PaymentForm (`/src/components/payment/PaymentForm.jsx`)

- Secure payment form with card validation
- Supports billing address (same as shipping or different)
- Real-time form validation and formatting
- Simulated payment processing with 90% success rate
- Handles payment errors gracefully

### 4. PaymentSuccess (`/src/components/payment/PaymentSuccess.jsx`)

- Order confirmation page
- Displays transaction details and receipt
- Shows estimated delivery dates
- Provides next steps and contact information
- Print receipt functionality

### 5. TestPayment (`/src/components/TestPayment.jsx`)

- Standalone test component for payment system
- Uses mock artwork data
- Accessible via `/test-payment` route
